        Coming face to face with madmen: _ 
        Crooked teeth and twisted smiles. _ 
        Burglary, assault, murder, rape: _ 
        The list goes on for miles. _ 
        In the glimpse of horrors, _ 
        We draw our swords with tortured tongues _ 
        Wishing to lay to waste the perpetrators _ 
        And becoming vigilant for everyone. _ 
         _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _ 
         _ 
        So foul and deceiving, _ 
        Clever and conniving: _ 
        In search of blood, _ 
        Never compromising. _ 
        Relentless tragedy _ 
        Wrought with insanity _ 
        Unleashed on us all: _ 
        Utter calamity. _ 
        Victimless?  No, it’s not. _ 
        They are found; alive for nought. _ 
        You’ll fight to the death. _ 
        One shall rise, the rest shall rot. _ 
         _ 
        Victimless?  No, it’s not. _ 
         _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _ 
        'Come and play' is all they say… _

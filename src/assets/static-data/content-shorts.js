                I built an interactive interface using flash and flashbuilder around 2010 at my second
                development position. around 2020, I started taking online courses for
                game development using Unity and now, Unreal Engine. It's the most fun I've had
                developing software so far, other than making this site.

                of that stuff is long gone, sitting in a dump somewhere on one of my old machines. I will
                try to get some stuff up here eventually. I am having a lot more fun doing 3D stuff at the
                moment.

                this is my true passion. I have always been intrigued by 3D graphics and animation. I started
                dabbling in this space around 1998. I never did anything truly impressing until the beginning of
                April 2024. I am taking a bunch of online courses from Udemy on solid and organic modeling... also
                learning about nodes.

                I began playing in 1987. My step-brother taught me how to play Rock You Like a Hurricane, and
                I've been playing ever since - badly. I started taking lessons at CA House Music in 2023, and
                have made some good progress. You'll get to hear some on this site. I'm trying to learn
                a bit of folk.

                I believe I started writing back in 1999 in a hospital. I was writing poetry about love
                and loss. I probably cranked out 15 poems while I was there. I have 2 binders full now. I
                don't write poetry much anymore, but I do like to write short stories and game concepts.
                I'll share some.
